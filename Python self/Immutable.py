# Immutable objects are objects whose state cannot be modified after they are created. When you modify the value of an
# immutable object, a new object is created in memory rather than modifying the existing one. 
# Immutable objects in Python include: integers, floats, complex numbersâ€žbooleans strings, tuples, frozensets.

x = 5
print(id(x))  # Memory address of integer 5

x+=1
print(id(x))  # Memory address of integer 6 (different from the previous one)
