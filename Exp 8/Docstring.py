Docstring In Python, a docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first
statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. It is used to
provide documentation about the purpose, usage, and behavior of the module,
function, class, or method. Docstrings are enclosed in triple quotes (either
single or double) and can span multiple lines. They serve as a form of inline
documentation that can be accessed using various tools, such as Pythonâ€™s
built-in help() function, documentation generators like Sphinx, and integrated
development environments (IDEs) that offer code introspection features.'''
